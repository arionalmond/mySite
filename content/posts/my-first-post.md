I wanted to create a site that would be hosted on github, some blog stuff, and document the quickest way I'm currently seeing to get the job done.  
Hugo is looking good so far. Going to roll with it for now. Should be sufficient for a static minimal cost site!  
Going to leave the original date I spun this up and created this post, FYI.  
Will update soon on future plans and what I'm **also** currently working on!
